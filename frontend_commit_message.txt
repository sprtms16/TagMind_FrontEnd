refactor(frontend): Address PR feedback for frontend (round 6)

- **test/widget_test.dart**: Removed unnecessary blank lines for improved readability.
- **lib/screens/home_screen.dart**: Optimized `initState` to reduce network calls by fetching all diaries once and filtering locally. Also improved `TextField` contrast in `AppBar` by using `onPrimary` color.
- **lib/providers/iap_provider.dart**: Added a TODO comment to `purchaseTagPack` regarding more robust premium status handling from the backend.
- **lib/screens/diary_edit_screen.dart**: Made `_groupTagsByCategory` static for better code organization and removed redundant `.cast<Widget>()` call.
