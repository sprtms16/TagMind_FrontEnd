refactor(frontend): Address PR feedback for frontend (round 4)

- **lib/models/diary.dart**: Simplified tag list parsing logic using null-aware operators.
- **lib/screens/home_screen.dart**: Removed unnecessary null-coalescing operator for `Diary.content`.
- **lib/main.dart**: Defined primary color as a constant (`kPrimaryColor`) and reused it throughout `ThemeData` for better maintainability.
- **lib/screens/diary_edit_screen.dart**: Added validation to `_saveForm` to ensure at least one tag is selected before saving, preventing diaries with empty content.
