refactor(frontend): Address PR feedback for frontend (round 5)

- **test/widget_test.dart**: Added missing closing `});` for `Signup with valid credentials` test block.
- **lib/screens/diary_edit_screen.dart**: Added `if (!mounted) return;` checks before `await showDialog` and `setState` calls in `_saveForm` method to prevent errors if the widget is disposed.
- **lib/screens/tag_store_screen.dart**: Added `if (!mounted) return;` checks before `ScaffoldMessenger` calls after `purchaseTagPack` and in the `catch` block to prevent errors if the widget is disposed.
